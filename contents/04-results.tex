\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

The following section presents the findings of the study. The results are organized into qualitative results in section \ref{ssec:qual_results} and quantitative results in section \ref{ssec:quant_results}. Before presenting the results, the characteristics of the study participants are shortly described in section \ref{ssec:study_participants}.

\subsection{Study Participants} \label{ssec:study_participants}

Study participants were recruited through two channels: (1) students associated with the university chair for Enterprise Computing and (2) colleagues of the author. A total of 15 participants was recruited throughout July 2025. With 13 of the participants the experiment was conducted in August 2025, while 2 participants dropped out of the study due to time constraints. One participant was excluded from the analysis due to not following the instructions for the think aloud protocols sufficiently, producing unusable data. The final sample thus consists of 12 participants.

The participants were exclusively male, with additional demographic information presented in Table \ref{tab:age_dist} and Table \ref{tab:edu_bg}. The final sample consisted of 12 participants, with 5 in group (B) without explanations and 7 in group (E) with explanations.
