\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

The discussion section of this thesis will be split into three main parts: A summary of the main findings and the implications for the hypotheses and research questions posed in the introduction are presented in Section~\ref{ssec:summary}. Section \ref{ssec:implications} discusses the implications of these findings and suggests avenues for future research building on this work. Finally, Section \ref{ssec:limitations} addresses the limitations of the current study and how they might be mitigated in future work.

\subsection{Summary of Findings} \label{ssec:summary}

This thesis investigates the cognitions and metacognitions of LLM users in problem-solving tasks and the effect explanations have on these processes. Current research primarily focuses on methods for generating explanations, that are understandable to lay users, and their effects on task performance. This study sought to investigate how the underlying cognitive and metacognitive processes are affected by explanations.

Firstly study finds that problem solvers using LLMs exhibit a range of collaboration strategies, where the role of the LLM can vary from an interactive knowledge base to a collaborative partner. The choice of strategy is influenced by task-dependent factors, such as the complexity of the problem, the user's perception of their own expertise, and the perceived capabilities of the LLM. The decision for a given strategy is subconscious. Users can also change their strategy dynamically based on their evolving perceptions of the task and the LLM's performance. Explanations have no effect on the choice of collaboration strategy.

Secondly, users employ a variety of cognitive and metacognitive processes when encountering conflicts when interacting with LLMs. Processes like \textit{self-monitoring}, \textit{system monitoring}, and \textit{reflection} are used to manage these conflicts. The choice and effectiveness of these processes are influenced by similar factors as the collaboration strategies, including task complexity, user expertise, and LLM capabilities. However, the availability of explanation has non effect on these processes. In addition, users also exhibit learning effects, where they adapt their problem-solving strategies based on their experiences with the LLM over time. This includes adjusting their expectations of the LLM's capabilities and modifying their interaction strategies to better leverage the LLM's strengths and mitigate its weaknesses.

Thirdly, providing explanations for the LLM's outputs has effects on users' perception of the LLM, as well as their perception of the collaboration. Explanations have desirable effects on users' acceptance, self-efficacy, and perception of their own effort and performance, with statistically significant effects on \textit{perceived usefulness} and \textit{frustration}.

\subsection{Limitations} \label{ssec:limitations}

Based on the methodology and the design on the study this work has several limitations, that need to be considered when interpreting the findings. Limitations were mitigated wherever possible during the design and execution of the study, but some limitations remain.

Firstly, the study was designed, executed, and analysed by a single researcher. This introduces potential biases in all phases of the research process, from the design of the study to the interpretation of the results. This applies to the selection of tasks, the selection of models (including system prompts), the coding of qualitative data, and the interpretation of findings. To mitigate these limitations to some degree, established frameworks and methods were used wherever possible, e.g. using standardized questionnaires.

Secondly, the sample size of 12 participants in the final analysis is relatively small. While a sample size of 12 allows identifying themes and gather indications for patterns, it limits the generalizability of the findings. The small sample size also limits the statistical power of the quantitative analysis. To mitigate the limitation statistical tests suitable for small sample sizes were used, e.g. non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test. Despite the mitigation measures, the findings should be interpreted as indications and validated in future work with larger sample sizes.

Thirdly, the think-aloud methodology used in the study has inherent limitations. \cite{VanSomeren1994} note that participant may be afraid of being judged based on their verbalizations, which may lead to participants censoring their thoughts. This effect may be amplified when participants have a pre-existing relationship with the researcher, as was the case in this study. To mitigate this limitation, participants were assured that there were no right or wrong answers and that their honest thoughts and feelings were valued. Additionally, a cover story was used that framed the study as an investigation of LLMs rather than the participants' problem-solving abilities. However, despite these mitigation measures, the potential for social desirability bias remains.

Lastly, the study used a number of standardized questionnaires, which were translated without formal validation. While care was taken to ensure the translations were accurate and preserved the meaning of the original items, the lack of formal validation means that the psychometric properties of the translated questionnaires are unknown. This limitation may affect the reliability and validity of the quantitative findings.
