# Effects of Explainability Alternatives in Generative AI on Users' Cognition and Metacognition

This paper investigates the effects of explanations for generative AI on the users' cognition and metacognition. The paper consists of two core parts:

1. Elaborate on recent developments in generative AI explainability
2. Perform a formative study to determine cognitive patterns when interacting with generative AI (solving maths problems)

This repository contains the actual LaTeX code for the thesis and handles automated building of the paper. The code and data of the study will be placed in a separate repository, that will be linked here at a later date.

## Remarks

- I am working with the paper publicly available, because I want to encourage publishing even work-in-progress scientific research
- since this is a master thesis outside contributions are not permissible and will be ignored
