# Effects of Explanations on LLM-User’s Cognition and Metacognition

This paper investigates the effects of explanations for generative AI on the users' cognition and metacognition. This repository contains the LaTeX code for this master thesis.

Additional information and code used for the study performed in this thesis are available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/nimble-byte/thesis-code).

The paper consists of two core parts:

1. Elaborate on recent developments in generative AI explainability
2. Perform a formative study to determine cognitive patterns when interacting with generative AI (solving maths problems)

## Additional Information

I treated my thesis also as training ground, to (re)familiarise myself with development tooling and new features offered by GitHub. Therefore, this repository has GitHub Actions set up to automatically compile and publish the PDF of the thesis as [GitHub Release](https://github.com/nimble-byte/master-thesis/releases) artifacts:

- builds are run on all PRs to the `main` branch
- builds and publishing are run, if tags matching the glob pattern `v*.**` are pushed to the `main` branch

Additionally I experimented with GitHub issues and project boards to track progress and structure my work. All tickets created for this work are contained within this repository.

## Remarks

- I am working with the paper publicly available, because I want to encourage publishing even work-in-progress scientific research
- since this is a master thesis outside contributions are not permissible and will be ignored
- after the thesis is complete I am considering to archive this repository for documentation reasons
